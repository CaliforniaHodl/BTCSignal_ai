## What is a Swing Failure Pattern?

A **Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)** occurs when price breaks a previous swing high or low, but fails to close beyond that level. This "failure" to hold the breakout often signals a reversal.

SFPs are powerful because they:
- Trap breakout traders on the wrong side
- Sweep liquidity (stop losses)
- Signal institutional reversal intentions

## Bullish SFP (At a Low)

A **Bullish SFP** forms when:
1. Price breaks below a previous swing low
2. Wicks below that level (sweeps liquidity)
3. Closes ABOVE the previous low
4. Signals potential move higher

```
Previous Low ----X--------
                 |
                 |  Wick below (SFP)
                 |
           Close X-------- Above previous low
                 |
                /
               /  Price reverses up
```

### Why It Works
- Short sellers enter on the "breakdown"
- Stop losses from longs get triggered
- Smart money uses this liquidity to buy
- Trapped shorts fuel the move up

## Bearish SFP (At a High)

A **Bearish SFP** forms when:
1. Price breaks above a previous swing high
2. Wicks above that level (sweeps liquidity)
3. Closes BELOW the previous high
4. Signals potential move lower

```
               \
                \  Price reverses down
                 |
           Close X-------- Below previous high
                 |
                 |  Wick above (SFP)
                 |
Previous High ---X--------
```

### Why It Works
- Long buyers enter on the "breakout"
- Stop losses from shorts get triggered
- Smart money uses this liquidity to sell
- Trapped longs fuel the move down

## SFP vs Regular Breakout

| Breakout | SFP |
|----------|-----|
| Breaks AND closes beyond level | Breaks but closes back inside |
| Continuation signal | Reversal signal |
| Trade with the break | Trade against the break |
| Wick and body beyond | Only wick beyond |

## Trading the Swing Failure Pattern

### Entry Methods

**Method 1: Aggressive Entry**
- Enter immediately after the SFP candle closes
- Stop loss beyond the SFP wick
- Faster entry, slightly higher risk

**Method 2: Conservative Entry**
- Wait for next candle confirmation
- Enter on break of SFP candle high (bullish) or low (bearish)
- Stop loss beyond the SFP wick
- More confirmation, may miss some moves

### Stop Loss Placement

| SFP Type | Stop Loss Location |
|----------|-------------------|
| Bullish SFP | Below the SFP wick low |
| Bearish SFP | Above the SFP wick high |

Always give a small buffer (few ticks/pips) beyond the wick.

### Target Setting

1. **Conservative:** Previous swing in the opposite direction
2. **Moderate:** 1:2 or 1:3 risk-reward ratio
3. **Aggressive:** Next major structure level

## SFP Quality Factors

Not all SFPs are created equal. Look for:

### 1. Clean Swing Point
The level being swept should be obvious - a clear high or low that traders would notice.

### 2. Quick Rejection
The faster price returns inside the level, the stronger the SFP. Immediate rejection > slow drift back.

### 3. Volume Spike
High volume on the SFP candle shows heavy participation (stops being hit, smart money entering).

### 4. Higher Timeframe Alignment
SFPs at higher timeframe levels are more significant:
- Daily SFP > 4H SFP > 1H SFP

### 5. Trend Context
- SFPs with the higher timeframe trend = higher probability
- Counter-trend SFPs can work but are riskier

## SFP + Other Concepts

SFPs combine well with:

| Concept | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| Order Blocks | SFP at an OB = strong confluence |
| Fair Value Gaps | SFP filling an FVG = double signal |
| Market Structure | SFP at structure level = key zone |
| Fibonacci | SFP at 61.8% or 78.6% = high probability |

## Bitcoin SFP Examples

Bitcoin produces excellent SFPs because:
- High leverage creates stop clusters
- 24/7 trading allows clean patterns
- Liquidation cascades create wicks
- Strong institutional participation

### Common Bitcoin SFP Scenarios

1. **Range highs/lows** - SFP at range boundaries
2. **Previous day high/low** - Intraday SFPs
3. **Weekly high/low** - Swing trade setups
4. **ATH/ATL regions** - Major reversal signals

## Common Mistakes

1. **Trading every SFP** - Be selective, wait for quality setups
2. **Ignoring context** - Consider the trend and timeframe
3. **Tight stops** - Give room beyond the wick
4. **No confirmation** - Wait for close, not just the wick
5. **Wrong timeframe** - Match to your trading style

## SFP Checklist

Before trading an SFP, confirm:

- [ ] Clear swing high/low being tested
- [ ] Wick beyond the level
- [ ] Close back inside the level
- [ ] Reasonable risk-reward (minimum 1:2)
- [ ] Aligned with higher timeframe bias
- [ ] Volume/momentum supporting reversal

## Summary

| Type | Forms At | Signal | Trade Direction |
|------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Bullish SFP | Swing low | Fake breakdown | Long |
| Bearish SFP | Swing high | Fake breakout | Short |

The Swing Failure Pattern is one of the most reliable reversal signals in trading. It shows where smart money trapped retail traders and reversed the market.
