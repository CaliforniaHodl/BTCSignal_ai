## What Are Fibonacci Retracements?

Fibonacci retracements are horizontal lines that indicate potential support and resistance levels based on key Fibonacci ratios. These levels help predict where price might retrace before continuing its trend.

**Key Ratios:** 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%

The 61.8% ratio (the "golden ratio") is considered the most significant.

## The Fibonacci Sequence

The ratios come from the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...

Each number is the sum of the two before it. The ratios between consecutive numbers converge to 0.618 (61.8%).

Why does this work in trading? Markets are driven by human psychology, and Fibonacci ratios appear throughout nature and human behavior.

## Drawing Fibonacci Retracements

### In an Uptrend

Draw from the **swing low** to the **swing high**:

```
Price:
                      100% (High)
                  /\
                 /  \
                /    \ 23.6%
               /      \
              /        \ 38.2%
             /          \
            /            \ 50%
           /              \
          /                \ 61.8%
         /                  \
        /                    \ 78.6%
       /
      0% (Low)
```

### In a Downtrend

Draw from the **swing high** to the **swing low**:

```
Price:
      0% (High)
       \
        \                    / 78.6%
         \                  /
          \                / 61.8%
           \              /
            \            / 50%
             \          /
              \        / 38.2%
               \      /
                \    / 23.6%
                 \  /
                  \/
                      100% (Low)
```

## Key Fibonacci Levels

| Level | Significance | Typical Behavior |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| 23.6% | Shallow | Brief pause in strong trends |
| 38.2% | Moderate | Common pullback in strong trends |
| 50% | Important | Psychological halfway point |
| 61.8% | Golden Ratio | Most watched level, strong S/R |
| 78.6% | Deep | Last line of defense before reversal |

## Trading Fibonacci Retracements

### Strategy 1: Buy the Pullback

In an uptrend:

1. Identify clear uptrend with higher highs/lows
2. Draw Fib from swing low to swing high
3. Wait for price to pull back to 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%
4. Look for bullish price action at Fib level
5. Enter long with stop below the 78.6% level
6. Target previous high or 1.618 extension

### Strategy 2: Sell the Bounce

In a downtrend:

1. Identify clear downtrend with lower highs/lows
2. Draw Fib from swing high to swing low
3. Wait for price to bounce to 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%
4. Look for bearish price action at Fib level
5. Enter short with stop above the 78.6% level
6. Target previous low or 1.618 extension

### Strategy 3: Fib Confluence

When multiple Fibs align at the same price:

1. Draw Fibs from multiple swing points
2. Identify levels where multiple Fibs cluster
3. These "Fib clusters" are high-probability S/R zones
4. Trade the reaction at these levels

## Fibonacci Extensions

Extensions project where price might go after completing a retracement.

### Key Extension Levels

| Level | Use |
|-------|-----|
| 1.0 (100%) | Equal move |
| 1.272 | Conservative target |
| 1.618 | Golden extension, major target |
| 2.0 | Double move |
| 2.618 | Extended target |

### Drawing Extensions

For uptrend targets:
1. Identify swing low (A), swing high (B), and retracement low (C)
2. Draw from A to B, then extend from C
3. Extensions show potential upside targets

## Bitcoin and Fibonacci

Bitcoin respects Fibonacci levels remarkably well:

### Historical Examples

- **2017 Bull Run:** 61.8% retracement from ATH marked the bottom
- **2020 Crash:** Bounced almost exactly from 61.8% retracement
- **2021 Rally:** Multiple pullbacks to 38.2% before continuation

### Bitcoin-Specific Fib Tips

1. **Weekly Fibs are powerful** - Draw Fibs on weekly charts for major levels

2. **From cycle low to ATH** - These Fibs define the macro structure

3. **38.2% is bullish** - In bull markets, BTC often only retraces to 38.2%

4. **61.8% is the line** - If 61.8% breaks, expect deeper correction

5. **Multiple impulse Fibs** - Draw Fibs on each major impulse wave

## Combining Fibs with Other Tools

### Fib + Horizontal S/R

When a Fib level aligns with a previous horizontal S/R, it's extra significant.

### Fib + Moving Averages

| Fib Level | MA Alignment | Signal Strength |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 38.2% | EMA 20 | Strong support |
| 50% | SMA 50 | Very strong support |
| 61.8% | SMA 200 | Major support |

### Fib + RSI

| Fib Level | RSI Reading | Signal |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 61.8% | Oversold (<30) | Strong buy |
| 61.8% | Neutral | Moderate buy |
| 38.2% | Overbought (>70) | Strong sell |

### Fib + Order Blocks

When a Fib level aligns with an order block, expect a strong reaction.

## Common Fibonacci Mistakes

### 1. Wrong Anchor Points

Always use clear swing highs/lows:
- Significant turning points
- Visible on higher timeframes
- Clear price rejection

### 2. Over-Reliance on Single Fib

One Fib level isn't enough. Look for:
- Multiple Fib confluence
- Confirmation from other indicators
- Price action signals at the level

### 3. Fighting the Trend

Fibs work best when trading WITH the trend:
- In uptrend: Buy at Fib support
- In downtrend: Sell at Fib resistance

### 4. Ignoring Failed Fibs

If price blows through a Fib level with volume, don't expect it to hold. Move to the next level.

## Fib Trading Checklist

Before entering at a Fib level:

- [ ] Is the trend clear?
- [ ] Is this a valid swing high/low?
- [ ] Are there multiple Fibs at this level?
- [ ] Is there horizontal S/R confluence?
- [ ] Is there a price action signal?
- [ ] Where is my stop loss (usually past 78.6%)?

## Entry, Stop, and Target Rules

### Entry Rules

| Fib Level | Entry Type | Risk Level |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 38.2% | Aggressive | Higher risk |
| 50% | Moderate | Balanced |
| 61.8% | Conservative | Lower risk |

### Stop Loss Placement

| Trade Type | Stop Location |
|------------|---------------|
| Long at 38.2% | Below 61.8% |
| Long at 50% | Below 78.6% |
| Long at 61.8% | Below 100% (swing low) |

### Take Profit Targets

| Entry Level | TP1 | TP2 | TP3 |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| 61.8% | 38.2% | 0% (high) | 1.618 ext |
| 50% | 23.6% | 0% | 1.272 ext |
| 38.2% | 0% | 1.272 ext | 1.618 ext |

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Uptrend, price at 38.2% | Look for long entries |
| Uptrend, price at 61.8% | Strong long opportunity |
| Uptrend, breaks 78.6% | Trend may be over |
| Downtrend, bounce to 38.2% | Look for short entries |
| Downtrend, bounce to 61.8% | Strong short opportunity |
| Multiple Fibs cluster | High probability level |

## Summary

Fibonacci retracements are powerful tools for Bitcoin trading:

- **38.2%:** Shallow pullback, strong trends
- **50%:** Psychological midpoint
- **61.8%:** Golden ratio, most important level
- **78.6%:** Last defense, tight stops

Best results come from combining Fibs with other confluence factors.
