## TL;DR
- Extreme fear often presents buying opportunities
- Extreme greed often precedes corrections
- Sentiment is a contrarian indicator - go against the crowd at extremes

## What is Market Sentiment?

Market sentiment represents the overall attitude of investors toward a particular asset or market. In Bitcoin, sentiment swings between extreme fear (everyone is selling) and extreme greed (everyone is buying).

The key insight is that markets are driven by human emotion, and emotions tend to be most wrong at extremes.

## The Fear & Greed Index

The most popular sentiment indicator for crypto is the Fear & Greed Index, which ranges from 0 to 100:

| Score | Sentiment | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 0-24 | Extreme Fear | Potential buying opportunity |
| 25-44 | Fear | Market pessimistic |
| 45-55 | Neutral | No clear bias |
| 56-74 | Greed | Market optimistic |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Potential selling opportunity |

### What Goes Into the Index
- **Volatility** (25%): Higher volatility = more fear
- **Market momentum/volume** (25%): Rising prices = more greed
- **Social media** (15%): Sentiment analysis of posts
- **Bitcoin dominance** (10%): Higher dominance = more fear
- **Google Trends** (10%): Search interest in Bitcoin
- **Surveys** (15%): Polling of traders

## How to Trade Sentiment

### Contrarian Approach
The most successful sentiment traders go against the crowd:

**During Extreme Fear (0-24):**
- Start accumulating positions
- Look for support levels to buy
- DCA into the market
- Be prepared for more downside (fear can persist)

**During Extreme Greed (75-100):**
- Take profits on existing positions
- Tighten stop losses
- Avoid new leveraged longs
- Consider hedging or shorting

### Why Contrarian Works
When everyone is fearful:
- Most selling has already occurred
- Prices are often below fair value
- Few sellers remain to push prices lower

When everyone is greedy:
- Most buying has already occurred
- Prices are often above fair value
- Few buyers remain to push prices higher

## Social Sentiment Indicators

Beyond the Fear & Greed Index, monitor these sentiment sources:

### Crypto Twitter/X
- Extreme bullishness with rocket emojis = caution
- "Bitcoin is dead" posts = potential bottom
- Influencer sentiment often lags price

### Reddit (r/Bitcoin, r/CryptoCurrency)
- Suicide hotline posts = extreme fear (historically bottoms)
- "To the moon" everywhere = extreme greed

### YouTube
- All thumbnails showing massive green candles = top signal
- "I'm done with crypto" videos = bottom signal

### Funding Rates
- Highly positive funding = crowded long trade
- Highly negative funding = crowded short trade

## Sentiment Extremes in History

| Date | Sentiment | BTC Price | What Happened |

| Dec 2018 | Extreme Fear (10) | $3,200 | Bottom, 20x rally followed |
| Nov 2021 | Extreme Greed (84) | $69,000 | Top, 75% crash followed |

## Combining Sentiment with Technicals

Sentiment works best when combined with technical analysis:

### High Probability Setups

**Bullish Setup:**
- Extreme fear (0-24) PLUS
- Price at major support PLUS
- Oversold RSI (<30) PLUS
- Bullish divergence

**Bearish Setup:**
- Extreme greed (75-100) PLUS
- Price at major resistance PLUS
- Overbought RSI (>70) PLUS
- Bearish divergence

## Common Mistakes

1. **Acting too early**: Sentiment can stay extreme for weeks
2. **Ignoring price action**: Sentiment alone isn't enough
3. **Following the crowd**: Buying when everyone is greedy
4. **Fighting the trend**: Shorting in extreme greed during bull markets
5. **Over-relying on one indicator**: Use multiple sentiment sources

## Sentiment Trading Rules

1. **Only act at extremes**: Neutral sentiment provides no edge
2. **Use as confluence**: Combine with technical analysis
3. **Scale in gradually**: Don't go all-in at first fear reading
4. **Have patience**: Sentiment can stay extreme longer than expected
5. **Respect the trend**: Sentiment works better for timing, not direction

## Key Takeaways

- Sentiment is a contrarian indicator - fear = buy, greed = sell
- Extremes are where the real opportunities exist
- Never rely on sentiment alone - combine with technicals
- The crowd is usually wrong at turning points
- Be patient - extremes can persist before reversing
