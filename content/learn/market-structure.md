## What is Market Structure?

Market structure is the foundation of technical analysis. It refers to the pattern of **higher highs and higher lows** (bullish) or **lower highs and lower lows** (bearish) that price creates over time.

Understanding market structure helps you:
- Identify the current trend direction
- Find optimal entry and exit points
- Avoid trading against the trend

## Bullish Market Structure

A bullish market structure is characterized by:

1. **Higher Highs (HH)** - Each peak is higher than the previous peak
2. **Higher Lows (HL)** - Each pullback bottom is higher than the previous bottom

```
        HH
       /  \
      /    \
    HH      \    HH
   /  \      \  /
  /    \      HL
HL      HL
```

**Trading Tip:** In a bullish structure, look to buy at higher lows (support) rather than chasing higher highs.

## Bearish Market Structure

A bearish market structure shows:

1. **Lower Highs (LH)** - Each rally peak is lower than the previous
2. **Lower Lows (LL)** - Each drop creates a new low

```
LH
  \
   \    LH
    \  /  \
     LL    \    LH
            \  /
             LL    LL
```

**Trading Tip:** In a bearish structure, look to sell at lower highs (resistance) rather than trying to catch the falling knife.

## Break of Structure (BOS)

A **Break of Structure** occurs when price violates the current market structure pattern:

- **Bullish BOS:** Price breaks above a previous lower high in a downtrend
- **Bearish BOS:** Price breaks below a previous higher low in an uptrend

This is often the first sign of a potential trend reversal.

## Change of Character (ChoCH)

A **Change of Character** is a more significant structural shift that confirms a trend reversal. It typically includes:

1. A break of structure
2. A retest of the broken level
3. Continuation in the new direction

## Practical Application for Bitcoin

Bitcoin tends to respect market structure well due to its 24/7 trading and high liquidity. Key tips:

- **Use multiple timeframes:** Identify structure on the daily, then trade it on the 4H or 1H
- **Wait for confirmation:** Don't anticipate BOS, wait for it to happen
- **Combine with key levels:** Structure breaks at important support/resistance are more significant

## Summary

| Concept | Bullish | Bearish |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Highs | Higher Highs | Lower Highs |
| Lows | Higher Lows | Lower Lows |
| Trade Direction | Buy dips | Sell rallies |
| BOS Signal | Break above LH | Break below HL |

Understanding market structure is essential before moving on to more advanced concepts like order blocks, fair value gaps, and liquidity sweeps.
