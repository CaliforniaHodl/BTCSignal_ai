## What Is the Fear & Greed Index?

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment on a scale of 0-100:

| Range | Sentiment | Market State |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 0-24 | Extreme Fear | Potential buying opportunity |
| 25-49 | Fear | Market pessimism |
| 50 | Neutral | Balanced sentiment |
| 51-74 | Greed | Market optimism |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Potential selling opportunity |

**Key Principle:** "Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful." - Warren Buffett

## How Is It Calculated?

The index combines multiple data sources:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Volatility | 25% | Current vs 30/90 day avg volatility |
| Market Momentum | 25% | Volume and momentum vs averages |
| Social Media | 15% | Twitter/Reddit sentiment analysis |
| Surveys | 15% | Weekly crypto polls |
| Bitcoin Dominance | 10% | BTC vs altcoin market cap |
| Google Trends | 10% | Search volume for Bitcoin |

## Why Does It Work?

Markets are driven by human emotions:

**Fear:**
- Causes panic selling
- Creates oversold conditions
- Pushes prices below fair value
- Often marks bottoms

**Greed:**
- Causes FOMO buying
- Creates overbought conditions
- Pushes prices above fair value
- Often marks tops

The index quantifies these emotions.

## Trading with Fear & Greed

### Contrarian Strategy

The most effective approach:

**Buy Zone (Fear 0-25):**

2. Start accumulating BTC
3. Scale in more as fear increases
4. Heaviest buys at extreme fear (<15)

**Sell Zone (Greed 75-100):**
1. Index rises above 75
2. Start taking profits
3. Scale out more as greed increases
4. Defensive mode at extreme greed (>85)

### DCA Modification

| At support | Fear | Buy |
| At resistance | Greed | Sell |

|---------|-------------|
| Rapid drop into fear | Panic selling, watch for bottom |
| Slow grind into greed | Sustainable rally |
| Spike to extreme greed | FOMO top forming |
| Sustained extreme levels | Trend may continue |

### Duration at Extremes

| Duration | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 1-2 days extreme | Potential fakeout |
| 1-2 weeks extreme | Reversal likely |
| 1+ month extreme | Major trend change coming |

### Historical Context

## Combining Fear & Greed with Other Metrics

| Fear | < 40 | Buy |
| Greed | > 60 | Caution |

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating It as a Timing Tool

Extreme readings don't mean immediate reversal. Markets can stay irrational:
- Extreme greed can last weeks in bull runs
- Extreme fear can persist during bear markets

### 2. Ignoring the Trend

In strong trends, extreme readings may not matter:
- 2017 bull: Extreme greed for months
- 2018 bear: Extended fear periods

### 3. Acting on Daily Fluctuations

Don't trade every small move. Look for:
- Sustained extreme readings
- Divergence from price
- Confluence with other indicators

### 4. Using It Alone

F&G is a sentiment indicator, not a complete system. Always combine with:
- Technical analysis
- On-chain data
- Macro context

## Bitcoin-Specific Insights

1. **Halving cycles** - F&G tends to hit extreme greed 12-18 months post-halving

2. **Weekend readings** - Less reliable due to lower participation

3. **News sensitivity** - Major events can spike the index temporarily

4. **Altcoin correlation** - Extreme greed often means altcoin season

5. **Bear market bottoms** - Usually require multiple weeks of extreme fear

## Practical Application Framework

### Weekly Review

Every week, check:

1. Current F&G level
2. 7-day trend (rising or falling)
3. How long at current extreme
4. Comparison to price action

### Position Sizing Based on F&G

| F&G Level | Suggested Position Size |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 0-20 | 80-100% of intended allocation |
| 20-40 | 60-80% |
| 40-60 | 40-60% |
| 60-80 | 20-40% |
| 80-100 | 0-20% (or reducing) |

### Alert Levels

Set alerts for key levels:
- Below 20: "Accumulation Zone"
- Above 80: "Distribution Zone"
- Rapid changes (±20 in a week)

## Summary

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Extreme Fear = Buying opportunity | Accumulate BTC |
| Extreme Greed = Selling opportunity | Take profits |
| Sustained extremes | Major move coming |
| Use as confirmation | Not standalone signal |
| Combine with technicals | Stronger signals |

The Fear & Greed Index is one of the best contrarian tools for Bitcoin.
