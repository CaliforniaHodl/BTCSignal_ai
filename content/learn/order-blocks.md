## What is an Order Block?

An **Order Block (OB)** is the last candle before a significant price move. It represents the zone where institutional traders (smart money) accumulated or distributed their positions before driving price in their intended direction.

Order blocks are essentially:
- **Supply zones** (bearish OB) - Where selling occurred
- **Demand zones** (bullish OB) - Where buying occurred

## Why Order Blocks Matter

Institutional traders can't enter positions all at once - their orders are too large. Instead, they:

1. Accumulate/distribute in a range (the order block)
2. Drive price away from that zone
3. Wait for price to return
4. Add to their position at the same levels

This creates repeatable patterns traders can exploit.

## Identifying a Bullish Order Block

A **Bullish Order Block** is:
- The last DOWN (bearish/red) candle before a strong up move
- Often found at swing lows
- Acts as a demand zone (support)

```
         |
         |  Strong move up
         |  /
         | /
         |/
    [OB] X  <- Last down candle = Bullish OB
         |
         |
```

### Bullish OB Characteristics
- Last bearish candle before impulse up
- Usually has a strong close (near the high of the candle)
- The move after it breaks structure to the upside

## Identifying a Bearish Order Block

A **Bearish Order Block** is:
- The last UP (bullish/green) candle before a strong down move
- Often found at swing highs
- Acts as a supply zone (resistance)

```
         |
         |
    [OB] X  <- Last up candle = Bearish OB
         |\
         | \
         |  \
         |   Strong move down
```

### Bearish OB Characteristics
- Last bullish candle before impulse down
- Usually has a strong close (near the low of the candle)
- The move after it breaks structure to the downside

## Order Block Zones

When marking an order block, you have options:

| Zone | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Full candle body | Open to close | Conservative entries |
| Full candle range | High to low | Includes wicks |
| 50% of candle | Middle of body | Optimal entry zone |

## Trading Order Blocks

### Entry Strategy

1. **Identify the order block** on your chosen timeframe
2. **Wait for price to return** to the OB zone
3. **Look for confirmation** (reaction, lower timeframe structure)
4. **Enter the trade** within the OB zone
5. **Stop loss** beyond the OB (above for bearish, below for bullish)

### Confirmation Signals
- Lower timeframe change of character
- Engulfing candle at the OB
- Break and retest within the zone
- Multiple timeframe alignment

## Order Block Quality Factors

Not all order blocks are equal. Higher quality OBs have:

### 1. Imbalance (FVG)
Order blocks that create a Fair Value Gap are stronger - shows aggressive institutional activity.

### 2. Liquidity Grab
OB that swept previous liquidity before the move carries more significance.

### 3. Unmitigated
First-touch OBs are stronger than those price has already tested.

### 4. Higher Timeframe
Daily OB > 4H OB > 1H OB in terms of reliability.

### 5. In Trend Direction
OBs aligned with the higher timeframe trend are more likely to hold.

## Order Block vs Supply/Demand Zone

| Feature | Order Block | Supply/Demand |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Definition | Single candle before move | General price zone |
| Precision | More precise | Broader zone |
| Origin | Smart money concept | Classic TA |
| Identification | Last opposite candle | Multiple candles |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Every candle is NOT an order block** - Must have significant move after
2. **Ignoring the trend** - Trade OBs with the trend
3. **No confirmation** - Wait for reaction, don't blindly buy/sell
4. **Wrong timeframe** - Match OB timeframe to your trading style
5. **Overleveraging** - OBs can fail; manage risk

## Bitcoin Order Blocks

Bitcoin's 24/7 market creates clear order blocks because:
- High liquidity allows institutional accumulation
- Leverage liquidations create sharp moves
- Clear structure on multiple timeframes

### Best Bitcoin OB Timeframes
- **Scalping:** 5m, 15m OBs
- **Day trading:** 1H, 4H OBs
- **Swing trading:** 4H, Daily OBs
- **Position trading:** Daily, Weekly OBs

## Combining Order Blocks with Other Concepts

Order blocks work best with:

1. **Market Structure** - Trade OBs in trend direction
2. **Fair Value Gaps** - OB + FVG = high probability
3. **Liquidity** - OB near liquidity = optimal entry
4. **Fibonacci** - OB at key fib levels adds confluence

## Summary

| Type | Location | Acts As | Trade Direction |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Bullish OB | Swing low | Support/Demand | Long |
| Bearish OB | Swing high | Resistance/Supply | Short |

Order blocks reveal where institutional traders entered the market. By identifying these zones and waiting for price to return, you can align your trades with smart money flow.
