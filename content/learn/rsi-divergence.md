## What is RSI Divergence?

RSI (Relative Strength Index) divergence occurs when price action and the RSI indicator move in opposite directions. This disagreement between price and momentum often signals potential trend reversals.

Divergence is one of the most reliable reversal signals in technical analysis when used correctly.

## Types of RSI Divergence

### Regular Bullish Divergence

Occurs at the **bottom** of downtrends:
- **Price:** Makes a lower low
- **RSI:** Makes a higher low

```
Price:    \    /
           \  /
            \/  (Lower Low)

RSI:      \    /
           \_/  (Higher Low)
```

**Signal:** Bearish momentum is weakening. Potential bullish reversal ahead.

### Regular Bearish Divergence

Occurs at the **top** of uptrends:
- **Price:** Makes a higher high
- **RSI:** Makes a lower high

```
Price:        /\  (Higher High)
             /  \
            /    \

RSI:      /\     (Lower High)
         /  \___
```

**Signal:** Bullish momentum is weakening. Potential bearish reversal ahead.

### Hidden Bullish Divergence

Occurs during **pullbacks in uptrends**:
- **Price:** Makes a higher low
- **RSI:** Makes a lower low

**Signal:** Trend continuation. The uptrend is likely to resume.

### Hidden Bearish Divergence

Occurs during **rallies in downtrends**:
- **Price:** Makes a lower high
- **RSI:** Makes a higher high

**Signal:** Trend continuation. The downtrend is likely to resume.

## RSI Settings for Bitcoin

Standard RSI settings work well for Bitcoin:

| Timeframe | RSI Period | Overbought | Oversold |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1H | 14 | 70 | 30 |
| 4H | 14 | 70 | 30 |
| Daily | 14 | 70 | 30 |
| Weekly | 14 | 80 | 20 |

**Pro Tip:** On higher timeframes, use 80/20 levels as Bitcoin can stay overbought/oversold longer.

## How to Trade RSI Divergence

### Entry Rules

1. **Identify the divergence** on your chosen timeframe
2. **Wait for confirmation:**
   - Break of recent swing high/low
   - Candlestick pattern (engulfing, pin bar)
   - RSI crossing back from extreme zone
3. **Enter on the confirmation candle close**

### Stop Loss Placement

- **Bullish divergence:** Below the recent swing low
- **Bearish divergence:** Above the recent swing high

### Take Profit Targets

- **Target 1:** Previous swing high/low
- **Target 2:** Key support/resistance level
- **Target 3:** 1.618 Fibonacci extension

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trading Divergence in Isolation

Divergence works best when combined with:
- Key support/resistance levels
- Market structure (BOS/ChoCH)
- Order blocks and FVGs

### 2. Ignoring the Trend

Regular divergence signals reversals, but reversals against strong trends often fail. Look for:
- Multiple divergence signals
- Confluence with key levels
- Volume confirmation

### 3. Acting Too Early

Wait for confirmation! Divergence can persist for multiple candles before price reverses.

## Bitcoin-Specific Tips

1. **Weekly RSI divergence is powerful** - When BTC shows divergence on the weekly chart, major moves often follow

2. **Check multiple timeframes** - Divergence on the 4H confirmed by the daily is stronger than 1H alone

3. **Combine with funding rates** - RSI divergence + extreme funding rates = high probability setup

## Practical Example

**Setup:** BTC makes a lower low at $60,000, but RSI makes a higher low

**Confirmation:** Price breaks above the previous swing high at $62,000

**Entry:** $62,100 on candle close

**Stop Loss:** $59,500 (below the swing low)

**Target:** $65,000 (previous resistance)

**Risk:Reward:** 1:1.1

## Summary

| Divergence Type | Price Action | RSI Action | Signal |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Regular Bullish | Lower Low | Higher Low | Buy reversal |
| Regular Bearish | Higher High | Lower High | Sell reversal |
| Hidden Bullish | Higher Low | Lower Low | Buy continuation |
| Hidden Bearish | Lower High | Higher High | Sell continuation |

RSI divergence is a powerful tool, but always use it with other forms of analysis for best results.
