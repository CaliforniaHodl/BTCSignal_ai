## What is a Fair Value Gap?

A **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** is a three-candle pattern where the middle candle's body creates a gap between the wicks of the surrounding candles. This gap represents an **imbalance** in price where one side (buyers or sellers) dominated so strongly that price moved too quickly.

These gaps often act as magnets - price tends to return to "fill" them.

## How to Identify a Fair Value Gap

### Bullish FVG (Price moving up)
```
        |
        |
   [3]  |    <- Candle 3 low is ABOVE Candle 1 high
        |
        |====|  <- GAP (Fair Value Gap)
        |
   [2]  |||||   <- Strong bullish candle
        |
   [1]  |    <- Candle 1 high
        |
```

**Bullish FVG** = Gap between Candle 1's HIGH and Candle 3's LOW

### Bearish FVG (Price moving down)
```
   [1]  |    <- Candle 1 low
        |
   [2]  |||||   <- Strong bearish candle
        |
        |====|  <- GAP (Fair Value Gap)
        |
   [3]  |    <- Candle 3 high is BELOW Candle 1 low
        |
```

**Bearish FVG** = Gap between Candle 1's LOW and Candle 3's HIGH

## Why Do FVGs Form?

Fair Value Gaps occur due to:

1. **Aggressive buying/selling** - One side overwhelms the market
2. **News events** - Sudden moves create imbalance
3. **Liquidation cascades** - Forced exits move price rapidly
4. **Low liquidity periods** - Gaps more common in thin markets

## Why Price Returns to Fill FVGs

Price tends to revisit FVGs because:

- **Unfilled orders** - Traders who missed the move wait for a retest
- **Profit taking** - Early movers exit at better prices
- **Mean reversion** - Markets seek equilibrium
- **Institutional rebalancing** - Large players average positions

## Trading Fair Value Gaps

### Strategy 1: FVG as Support/Resistance

1. Identify an FVG on your timeframe
2. Wait for price to retrace to the gap
3. Look for reaction (rejection candle)
4. Enter in the direction of the original move

### Strategy 2: FVG Fill and Continue

1. After an FVG forms, wait for price to fill 50% of the gap
2. Enter in the direction of the original trend
3. Stop loss beyond the full gap
4. Target: new highs/lows

### Entry Zones Within FVG

| Zone | Risk Level | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Top of FVG | Lower risk | Better entry, may not reach |
| Middle (50%) | Balanced | Common fill point |
| Bottom of FVG | Higher risk | Full fill, may break through |

## FVG + Other Concepts

FVGs work best when combined with:

- **Order Blocks** - FVG inside an order block = high probability
- **Market Structure** - Trade FVGs in trend direction
- **Liquidity** - FVG near liquidity = potential reversal zone
- **Key Levels** - FVG at support/resistance = confluence

## Bitcoin FVG Examples

Bitcoin creates FVGs frequently due to:
- 24/7 trading with varying liquidity
- High volatility and leverage
- News-driven moves (ETF flows, regulations)
- Weekend gaps on CME futures

### Common Bitcoin FVG Scenarios

1. **Post-news FVGs** - Often fill within 24-48 hours
2. **Weekly open FVGs** - Sunday/Monday frequently fill
3. **Trend FVGs** - May take days/weeks to fill
4. **Reversal FVGs** - Form at major turning points

## FVG Mitigation vs Inversion

### Mitigation
- Price fills the FVG and continues in the original direction
- The FVG "worked" as support/resistance

### Inversion
- Price fills the FVG and breaks through
- What was support becomes resistance (or vice versa)
- Often signals trend change

## Practical Tips

1. **Higher timeframe FVGs are more significant** - Daily > 4H > 1H
2. **Fresh FVGs are stronger** - First retest often best
3. **Consider the trend** - Trade FVGs WITH the trend
4. **Multiple touches weaken FVGs** - Each fill reduces significance
5. **Some FVGs never fill** - Strong trends can leave gaps unfilled

## Summary

| Aspect | Bullish FVG | Bearish FVG |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Forms on | Strong up move | Strong down move |
| Gap location | Between C1 high & C3 low | Between C1 low & C3 high |
| Acts as | Support | Resistance |
| Trade direction | Long on fill | Short on fill |

Fair Value Gaps are powerful tools when combined with proper market structure analysis and risk management.
