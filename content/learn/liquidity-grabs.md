## What is Liquidity?

In trading, **liquidity** refers to resting orders in the market - specifically stop losses and pending orders that sit at predictable levels. These orders represent potential fuel for price movement.

Liquidity typically clusters at:
- **Swing highs and lows** (where traders place stops)
- **Round numbers** ($100,000, $95,000, etc.)
- **Previous support and resistance levels**

## What is a Liquidity Grab?

A **liquidity grab** (also called a stop hunt or liquidity sweep) occurs when price moves to a level where many stop losses are resting, triggers those stops, and then reverses direction.

This happens because:
1. Large players need liquidity to fill their orders
2. Retail stop losses provide that liquidity
3. Once filled, price continues in the intended direction

## Anatomy of a Liquidity Grab

```
     Previous High (Liquidity)
          |
          v
    ------X------ Stop losses resting here
         /\
        /  \
       /    \  <- Price spikes above, grabs stops
      /      \
     /        \
----/          \----
                \
                 \  <- Price reverses and drops
                  \
```

## Types of Liquidity Grabs

### 1. Buy-Side Liquidity Grab
- Price sweeps above a swing high
- Triggers stop losses from short positions
- Triggers buy stops from breakout traders
- Often followed by a reversal down

### 2. Sell-Side Liquidity Grab
- Price sweeps below a swing low
- Triggers stop losses from long positions
- Triggers sell stops from breakdown traders
- Often followed by a reversal up

## How to Identify Liquidity Grabs

Look for these characteristics:

1. **Quick wick/spike** - Price moves rapidly to the level and back
2. **High volume** - Stop triggers create volume spikes
3. **Key level violation** - Just barely breaks the previous high/low
4. **Immediate reversal** - Price doesn't hold above/below the level

## Trading Liquidity Grabs

### Wait for the Sweep
Don't buy breakouts or sell breakdowns immediately. Wait for:
- Price to sweep the level
- Signs of rejection (long wicks, reversal candles)
- Confirmation of the reversal

### Entry Strategy
1. Identify clear liquidity levels (swing highs/lows)
2. Wait for price to sweep the level
3. Look for rejection signs (engulfing candle, pin bar)
4. Enter in the direction of the reversal
5. Place stop loss beyond the liquidity grab wick

### Example Trade Setup
```
Entry: After sweep and rejection candle
Stop Loss: Above/below the sweep wick
Target: Previous structure or opposing liquidity
```

## Bitcoin-Specific Liquidity Zones

Bitcoin has predictable liquidity at:

| Level Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Round numbers | $100K, $95K, $90K |
| Previous ATH | ~$73,800 (2024 high) |
| CME gaps | Weekend price gaps |
| Exchange liquidation levels | Shown on heatmaps |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Buying breakouts too early** - Wait for confirmation
2. **Placing stops at obvious levels** - Your stop IS the liquidity
3. **Ignoring the bigger picture** - Check higher timeframes
4. **Fighting the trend** - Liquidity grabs work best with trend

## Summary

Liquidity grabs are a core concept in smart money trading. Key takeaways:

- Liquidity = resting stop losses and pending orders
- Smart money hunts this liquidity to fill large positions
- Wait for sweeps and reversals instead of chasing breakouts
- Place stops where liquidity ISN'T clustered
