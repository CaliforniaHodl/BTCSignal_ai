## What Are Support & Resistance?

Support and resistance are price levels where buying or selling pressure historically causes price to react. These invisible "walls" form the foundation of technical analysis.

- **Support:** A price level where buying pressure prevents further decline
- **Resistance:** A price level where selling pressure prevents further advance

## Why Do These Levels Work?

Support and resistance levels work because of **market psychology**:

1. **Memory** - Traders remember where they bought/sold before
2. **Pending orders** - Limit orders cluster at round numbers and previous turning points
3. **Self-fulfilling prophecy** - Many traders watch the same levels

## Types of Support & Resistance

### 1. Horizontal Levels

The most basic form - price levels that have caused reactions in the past.

```
Price rejects resistance multiple times:

---R---R---R---R--- (Resistance)
  /\  /\  /\  /\
 /  \/  \/  \/  \

---S---S---S---S--- (Support)
Price bounces from support multiple times
```

**Key Rule:** The more times a level is tested, the stronger it becomes, BUT eventually it will break.

### 2. Dynamic Support & Resistance

Moving averages and trendlines that shift with price:

- **EMA 20** - Short-term dynamic S/R
- **SMA 50** - Medium-term dynamic S/R
- **SMA 200** - Long-term dynamic S/R (very important for BTC)

### 3. Psychological Levels

Round numbers where orders naturally cluster:

| Level Type | Bitcoin Examples |
|------------|------------------|
| Major | $50,000, $100,000 |
| Minor | $75,000, $85,000 |
| Micro | $92,500, $97,500 |

**Pro Tip:** Bitcoin tends to wick through round numbers before reversing.

### 4. Previous Highs and Lows

- **All-Time High (ATH)** - Major resistance
- **Yearly Highs/Lows** - Strong levels
- **Monthly/Weekly/Daily Highs/Lows** - Important for active traders

## How to Draw Support & Resistance

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Zoom out** - Start on higher timeframes (Weekly, Daily)
2. **Identify swing points** - Look for obvious price reversals
3. **Draw horizontal lines** - Connect multiple touch points
4. **Prioritize zones over exact levels** - Markets are messy, use ranges

### Zone vs. Line

Professional traders use **zones**, not precise lines:

```
     Resistance Zone
======================
|   /\    /\    /\   |
|  /  \  /  \  /  \  |
======================

======================
|  \  /  \  /  \  /  |
|   \/    \/    \/   |
======================
     Support Zone
```

**Zone width:** Typically 0.5-2% of price on higher timeframes.

## Trading Support & Resistance

### Strategy 1: Bounce Trading

Trade the reaction at support/resistance:

**Buy at Support:**
1. Price approaches strong support
2. Look for bullish candlestick pattern
3. Enter long with stop below support zone
4. Target next resistance

**Sell at Resistance:**
1. Price approaches strong resistance
2. Look for bearish candlestick pattern
3. Enter short with stop above resistance zone
4. Target next support

### Strategy 2: Breakout Trading

Trade the break of support/resistance:

1. Price consolidates near level
2. Volume increases
3. Price closes decisively through level
4. Enter on retest (if it happens)
5. Stop loss on opposite side of breakout

### Strategy 3: Role Reversal

When support breaks, it becomes resistance (and vice versa):

```
Price breaks support, retests as resistance:

=====R===== (Was Support, Now Resistance)
     |\
     | \
     |  \____
     |
=====S===== (New Support)
```

This is one of the highest probability setups in trading.

## Bitcoin-Specific Levels

### Key Historical Levels for BTC

- **$20,000** - 2017 ATH, major psychological level
- **$30,000** - Key level, heavily traded
- **$42,000** - Previous cycle resistance
- **$50,000** - Major psychological level
- **$69,000** - 2021 ATH
- **$100,000** - Next major psychological level

### Finding Current Levels

Our AI identifies key levels daily by analyzing:
- Volume profile clusters
- Previous day/week/month highs and lows
- Order book liquidity

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Drawing Too Many Lines

More lines = analysis paralysis. Focus on **key** levels only.

### 2. Being Too Precise

Markets don't respect exact numbers. Use **zones**.

### 3. Ignoring Context

A level in a strong trend may be blown through easily. Consider:
- Overall trend direction
- Momentum (RSI, MACD)
- Volume at the level

### 4. Front-Running Levels

Don't place orders exactly at support/resistance. Wait for:
- A candle close confirmation
- Price action signal
- Or use a small buffer

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

Always confirm levels across timeframes:

| Timeframe | Use For |
|-----------|---------|
| Weekly | Major levels for swing trades |
| Daily | Key levels for position trades |
| 4H | Entry zones for day trades |
| 1H | Fine-tuning entries |

**Rule:** Trade in the direction of higher timeframe levels.

## Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Support | Price floor - buying pressure |
| Resistance | Price ceiling - selling pressure |
| Zone | Range of prices, not exact line |
| Role Reversal | Broken S becomes R (and vice versa) |
| Confluence | Level confirmed by multiple factors |

Mastering support and resistance is essential for profitable trading.
