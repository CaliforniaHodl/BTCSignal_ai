## Understanding Candlesticks

Each candlestick shows four pieces of data:
- **Open:** Starting price
- **High:** Highest price during period
- **Low:** Lowest price during period
- **Close:** Ending price

```
Bullish Candle:     Bearish Candle:
     |                    |
     | Upper Wick         | Upper Wick
   __|__                __|__
  |     |  Body        |#####|  Body
  |     |              |#####|
   -----               ------
     |                    |
     | Lower Wick         | Lower Wick
```

- **Green/White:** Close > Open (bullish)
- **Red/Black:** Close < Open (bearish)

## Reversal Candlestick Patterns

### Doji

A candle where open and close are nearly equal.

```
     |
     +  <- Doji
     |
```

**Types:**
| Doji Type | Appearance | Signal |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Standard | + shape | Indecision |
| Dragonfly | T shape | Bullish at support |
| Gravestone | Inverted T | Bearish at resistance |

**Trading:** Wait for confirmation candle before acting.

### Hammer / Hanging Man

Small body at top, long lower wick (2x+ body length).

```
     __
    |  |  <- Small body
    ----
      |
      |   <- Long lower wick
      |
```

- **Hammer:** Appears at bottom of downtrend = Bullish reversal
- **Hanging Man:** Appears at top of uptrend = Bearish warning

### Inverted Hammer / Shooting Star

Small body at bottom, long upper wick.

```
      |
      |   <- Long upper wick
      |
     __
    |  |  <- Small body
    ----
```

- **Inverted Hammer:** At bottom = Bullish reversal
- **Shooting Star:** At top = Bearish reversal (high probability)

### Engulfing Patterns

Two-candle pattern where second candle "engulfs" the first.

```
Bullish Engulfing:        Bearish Engulfing:

    ___                      ___
   |###|                    |   |
   |###|  <- Small red     |   |  <- Small green
    ---                      ---
   _____                    _____
  |     |                  |#####|
  |     |  <- Large green  |#####|  <- Large red
  |     |                  |#####|
   -----                    -----
```

**Bullish Engulfing:** At support = Strong buy signal
**Bearish Engulfing:** At resistance = Strong sell signal

### Morning Star / Evening Star

Three-candle reversal patterns.

**Morning Star (Bullish):**
1. Long red candle
2. Small body (star) - gaps down
3. Long green candle - closes into first candle's body

**Evening Star (Bearish):**
1. Long green candle
2. Small body (star) - gaps up
3. Long red candle - closes into first candle's body

### Three White Soldiers / Three Black Crows

Three consecutive candles signaling strong reversal.

```
Three White Soldiers:     Three Black Crows:

         ___                  ___
        |   |                |###|
         ---                  ---
      ___                     ___
     |   |                   |###|
      ---                     ---
   ___                        ___
  |   |                      |###|
   ---                        ---
```

**Soldiers:** Strong bullish reversal
**Crows:** Strong bearish reversal

## Continuation Patterns

### Rising/Falling Three Methods

**Rising Three Methods (Bullish):**
1. Long green candle
2. Three small red candles (stay within first candle's range)
3. Long green candle (closes above first candle)

**Falling Three Methods (Bearish):**
- Opposite of above

Signal: Trend will continue.

### Spinning Top

Small body, wicks on both sides.

```
     |
   __|__
  |     |
   -----
     |
```

**Signal:** Indecision, wait for next candle.

## High-Probability Setups for Bitcoin

### 1. Hammer at Support

One of the best reversal setups:

Requirements:
- Clear support level
- Hammer candle forms at support
- Lower wick extends below support then closes above
- Confirmation: Next candle is green

### 2. Shooting Star at Resistance

Requirements:
- Clear resistance level
- Shooting star forms at resistance
- Upper wick extends above resistance then closes below
- Confirmation: Next candle is red

### 3. Engulfing at Key Levels

Requirements:
- At significant S/R level
- Full engulfing (body engulfs previous body)
- High volume on engulfing candle
- No need for additional confirmation - can enter immediately

## Candlestick Patterns Cheat Sheet

| Pattern | Signal | Strength | Confirmation Needed? |
|---------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Hammer | Bullish | Medium | Yes |
| Shooting Star | Bearish | High | Optional |
| Bullish Engulfing | Bullish | High | No |
| Bearish Engulfing | Bearish | High | No |
| Morning Star | Bullish | Very High | No |
| Evening Star | Bearish | Very High | No |
| Doji | Indecision | Low | Yes |
| Three Soldiers | Bullish | Very High | No |
| Three Crows | Bearish | Very High | No |

## Timeframe Considerations

| Timeframe | Reliability | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1H | Low | Day trading (with confluence) |
| 4H | Medium | Swing trading |
| Daily | High | Position trading |
| Weekly | Very High | Major reversals |

**Rule:** Higher timeframe patterns are more reliable.

## Combining Candlesticks with Other Analysis

### Candlesticks + Support/Resistance

Best combination. A shooting star at weekly resistance is very powerful.

### Candlesticks + RSI

| Candle Pattern | RSI Reading | Signal Quality |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Hammer | RSI < 30 | Excellent buy |
| Shooting Star | RSI > 70 | Excellent sell |
| Engulfing | Divergence | Very strong |

### Candlesticks + Volume

- **High volume** pattern = More reliable
- **Low volume** pattern = Wait for confirmation

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Trading Every Pattern

Not every hammer is a buy. Context matters:
- Where in the trend?
- At key level?
- Volume confirmation?

### 2. Ignoring the Trend

A bullish engulfing in a strong downtrend often fails. Trade with the trend, not against it.

### 3. Not Waiting for Close

The pattern isn't complete until the candle closes. Intra-candle patterns can reverse.

### 4. Wrong Timeframe

A 5-minute doji is noise. Focus on 4H and above.

## Bitcoin-Specific Tips

1. **Wicks are hunts** - Bitcoin loves to wick through obvious levels. Long wicks often indicate liquidity grabs.

2. **Sunday candles** - Weekly candle closes on Sunday. Watch for weekly patterns on Sunday evening.

3. **4H is king** - The 4-hour timeframe offers the best balance of signal quality and frequency for BTC.

4. **Combine with orderflow** - Large CVD divergence + reversal candle = high probability setup.

## Entry and Stop Loss Rules

### Entry

| Pattern | Entry Point |
|---------|-------------|
| Hammer | Above hammer high |
| Shooting Star | Below shooting star low |
| Engulfing | On candle close |
| Morning/Evening Star | On third candle close |

### Stop Loss

| Pattern | Stop Placement |
|---------|----------------|
| Hammer | Below hammer low |
| Shooting Star | Above shooting star high |
| Engulfing | Beyond engulfing candle |
| Morning/Evening Star | Beyond the star |

## Summary

| Category | Best Patterns |
|----------|--------------|
| Bullish Reversal | Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing, Hammer |
| Bearish Reversal | Evening Star, Bearish Engulfing, Shooting Star |
| Continuation | Three Methods, Inside Day |
| Indecision | Doji, Spinning Top |

Candlestick patterns work best at key levels with volume confirmation.
