## What is MACD?

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. It's one of the most popular and effective indicators for trading Bitcoin.

## MACD Components

The MACD consists of three elements:

1. **MACD Line:** 12-period EMA minus 26-period EMA
2. **Signal Line:** 9-period EMA of the MACD line
3. **Histogram:** MACD Line minus Signal Line

## Reading the MACD

### Above/Below Zero Line

| MACD Position | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Above zero | Short-term momentum > Long-term |
| Below zero | Short-term momentum < Long-term |
| Crossing above zero | Bullish momentum building |
| Crossing below zero | Bearish momentum building |

### MACD vs Signal Line

| Relationship | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| MACD above Signal | Bullish momentum |
| MACD below Signal | Bearish momentum |
| Crossover above | Buy signal |
| Crossover below | Sell signal |

### Histogram

The histogram shows momentum strength:

- **Growing green bars:** Strengthening bullish momentum
- **Shrinking green bars:** Weakening bullish momentum
- **Growing red bars:** Strengthening bearish momentum
- **Shrinking red bars:** Weakening bearish momentum

## Key MACD Trading Strategies

### 1. Signal Line Crossover

The most basic MACD strategy:

**Buy Signal:**
- MACD line crosses above Signal line
- Confirmation: Both lines below zero (more room to run)

**Sell Signal:**
- MACD line crosses below Signal line
- Confirmation: Both lines above zero

**Pro Tip:** Avoid crossover signals when MACD is flat near zero (choppy market).

### 2. Zero Line Crossover

More reliable but slower:

**Bullish:** MACD crosses above zero line
**Bearish:** MACD crosses below zero line

This confirms trend direction change, not just momentum.

### 3. MACD Divergence

Like RSI divergence, but using MACD:

**Bullish Divergence:**
- Price makes lower low
- MACD makes higher low
- Signal: Potential reversal up

**Bearish Divergence:**
- Price makes higher high
- MACD makes lower high
- Signal: Potential reversal down

### 4. Histogram Reversal

Watch for histogram peaks:

**Buy Setup:**
1. Histogram makes deep red bars
2. Red bars start shrinking
3. Enter when histogram turns green

**Sell Setup:**
1. Histogram makes tall green bars
2. Green bars start shrinking
3. Exit/short when histogram turns red

## MACD Settings for Bitcoin

### Standard Settings
- Fast EMA: 12
- Slow EMA: 26
- Signal: 9

### Aggressive Settings (More signals)
- Fast EMA: 8
- Slow EMA: 17
- Signal: 9

### Conservative Settings (Fewer, more reliable)
- Fast EMA: 19
- Slow EMA: 39
- Signal: 9

### Timeframe Recommendations

| Timeframe | Best Use |
|-----------|----------|
| 1H | Day trading signals |
| 4H | Swing trading |
| Daily | Position trading |
| Weekly | Major trend direction |

## Combining MACD with Other Indicators

### MACD + RSI

| MACD | RSI | Signal Strength |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Bullish crossover | RSI < 30 | Strong buy |
| Bullish crossover | RSI > 30 | Moderate buy |
| Bearish crossover | RSI > 70 | Strong sell |
| Bearish crossover | RSI < 70 | Moderate sell |

### MACD + Support/Resistance

MACD signals at key levels are more reliable:
- Bullish MACD crossover at support = High probability long
- Bearish MACD crossover at resistance = High probability short

### MACD + Volume

- MACD crossover + increasing volume = Strong signal
- MACD crossover + decreasing volume = Weak signal (possible fakeout)

## Common MACD Mistakes

### 1. Trading Every Crossover

Not all crossovers are equal. Avoid:
- Crossovers when MACD is flat near zero
- Crossovers against the major trend
- Crossovers without volume confirmation

### 2. Ignoring the Trend

MACD is a momentum indicator, not a trend indicator. Always know the trend first:
- In uptrends, focus on bullish crossovers
- In downtrends, focus on bearish crossovers

### 3. Using Wrong Timeframe

Higher timeframes = more reliable signals:
- Daily MACD crossover is more significant than 1H
- Weekly MACD crossover can signal major trend changes

### 4. Not Waiting for Confirmation

The crossover must be clear:
- Wait for the candle to close
- Ensure the crossover is decisive (not barely touching)

## Bitcoin-Specific MACD Tips

1. **Weekly MACD is powerful** - When BTC weekly MACD crosses bullish, major rallies often follow

2. **Watch the monthly** - Monthly MACD bullish = macro bull market

3. **Combine with halving cycles** - MACD tends to be bullish 12-18 months after halvings

4. **Divergence at ATH** - Bearish MACD divergence at all-time highs is a strong warning sign

## MACD Quick Reference

| Signal | Setup | Confirmation |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Buy | MACD crosses above Signal | Volume increase, RSI not overbought |
| Strong Buy | MACD crosses above zero | Both lines rising |
| Sell | MACD crosses below Signal | Volume increase, RSI not oversold |
| Strong Sell | MACD crosses below zero | Both lines falling |
| Reversal Warning | MACD divergence | Multiple timeframe confirmation |

## Entry and Exit Rules

### Entry

1. Identify trend direction on higher timeframe
2. Wait for MACD crossover in trend direction
3. Confirm with volume and price action
4. Enter on candle close

### Stop Loss

- Long: Below recent swing low
- Short: Above recent swing high

### Take Profit

- First target: When histogram starts reversing
- Second target: Next major support/resistance
- Final target: Opposite MACD crossover

## Summary

MACD is a versatile momentum indicator that works well for Bitcoin:

- **Crossovers** signal momentum shifts
- **Zero line** confirms trend direction
- **Histogram** shows momentum strength
- **Divergence** warns of reversals

Best results come from combining MACD with trend analysis and support/resistance.
