## TL;DR
- Emotions are your biggest enemy in trading
- Have a plan BEFORE you enter a trade
- Taking a break after losses is essential
- Journaling helps identify emotional patterns

## Why Emotions Destroy Traders

Studies show that individual traders underperform the market primarily due to emotional decision-making, not lack of knowledge. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you can't control your emotions, you'll lose money.

The four deadly emotions in trading:
1. **Fear** - Causes you to exit winners too early
2. **Greed** - Causes you to hold losers too long
3. **FOMO** - Causes you to chase entries at bad prices
4. **Revenge** - Causes you to over-trade after losses

## Understanding Fear in Trading

### How Fear Manifests
- Closing profitable trades too early
- Moving stop losses to break-even too quickly
- Not taking valid setups
- Reducing position size after a loss
- Hesitating on entries

### How to Handle Fear
1. **Accept that losses happen**: They're a cost of doing business
2. **Risk only what you can lose**: If a trade scares you, you're too big
3. **Trust your system**: If backtested, trust the process
4. **Use automated stops**: Remove yourself from the decision
5. **Focus on process, not outcome**: A good trade can still lose

## Understanding Greed in Trading

### How Greed Manifests
- Moving profit targets further away
- Not taking profits at planned levels
- Adding to winning positions recklessly
- Over-leveraging on "sure things"
- Holding through warning signs

### How to Handle Greed
1. **Set targets before entry**: Write them down
2. **Take partial profits**: Lock in gains along the way
3. **Use trailing stops**: Let the market decide when to exit
4. **Remember: pigs get slaughtered**: Don't get greedy
5. **Review past trades**: See how greed hurt you before

## Understanding FOMO

### How FOMO Manifests
- Entering after a big move already happened
- Chasing price instead of waiting for pullbacks
- Buying at resistance in a parabolic move
- Abandoning your strategy for "hot tips"
- Trading without a setup because "it's moving"

### How to Handle FOMO
1. **There's always another trade**: Missing one won't ruin you
2. **Set alerts, not orders**: Let the setup come to you
3. **Review missed trades**: Often you saved money
4. **Zoom out**: Is this move significant on the weekly chart?
5. **Calculate the risk**: FOMO entries usually have terrible R:R

## Understanding Revenge Trading

### How Revenge Trading Manifests
- Immediately re-entering after a stop loss
- Doubling down on a losing position
- Over-trading to "make back" losses
- Taking random trades out of frustration
- Abandoning risk management rules

### How to Handle Revenge Trading
1. **Step away after losses**: Mandatory 30-minute break
2. **Daily loss limit**: Stop trading after X% down
3. **Trade counting**: Max trades per day
4. **Physical cue**: Close the laptop, walk away
5. **Review, don't trade**: Journal the loss instead

## Building Emotional Discipline

### Pre-Trade Routine
Before every trade, ask yourself:
1. Is this a valid setup in my system?
2. What's my entry, stop loss, and target?
3. How much am I risking?
4. Am I in the right mental state?
5. Would I take this trade if I were up 10%? Down 10%?

### During the Trade
1. Don't watch every tick (especially on longer timeframes)
2. Trust your stops - don't move them emotionally
3. Stick to the plan - don't add or remove
4. Accept the outcome is uncertain
5. Focus on execution, not P&L

### Post-Trade Routine
1. Record the trade in your journal
2. Rate your emotional state (1-10)
3. Did you follow your rules?
4. What would you do differently?
5. What did you do well?

## The Trading Journal

A trading journal is the most powerful tool for emotional improvement:

### What to Record
- Date and time
- Asset and timeframe
- Entry, stop loss, target
- Actual exit and P&L
- Screenshot of the setup
- **Emotional state before/during/after**
- What you learned

### Reviewing Your Journal
Weekly, look for patterns:
- Do you lose more on certain days?
- Do emotions spike after winning/losing streaks?
- Are certain setups more emotional than others?
- When do you break rules most often?

## Creating Rules for Yourself

Write down personal rules and post them where you trade:

### Example Rules
1. No trading first 30 minutes after waking up
2. Max 3 trades per day
3. No trading after 2 consecutive losses
4. 50% position size on Mondays (historically weak day)
5. No trading during major news events
6. Review journal before trading

## The 24-Hour Rule

After any of these events, wait 24 hours before trading:
- Large unexpected loss
- Large unexpected win
- Major life stress (argument, bad news)
- Lack of sleep
- Alcohol consumption
- Strong emotional state (angry, excited, sad)

## Key Takeaways

- Emotions cause more losses than bad analysis
- Fear makes you exit early, greed makes you exit late
- FOMO and revenge trading are account killers
- A trading journal reveals your emotional patterns
- Rules and routines create discipline
- When in doubt, don't trade
