## What Is Bitcoin Dominance?

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) measures Bitcoin's market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap. It shows how much of the crypto market value is held in Bitcoin versus altcoins.

**Key Concept:** BTC dominance reflects risk appetite and capital flows within the crypto ecosystem.

## Calculating Bitcoin Dominance

```
BTC Dominance = (Bitcoin Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap) × 100

Example:
Bitcoin market cap: $2 trillion
Total crypto market cap: $3.5 trillion
BTC Dominance = ($2T / $3.5T) × 100 = 57.1%
```

## Historical Dominance Ranges

| Period | BTC Dominance | Market Condition |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| 2017 (early) | ~85% | Before ICO boom |
| 2018 (Jan) | ~33% | Alt season peak |
| 2019-2020 | ~60-70% | Post-crash recovery |
| 2021 (May) | ~40% | Alt season |
| 2022-2023 | ~45-50% | Bear market |
| 2024+ | ~50-60% | Institutional era |

## What Dominance Tells Us

### High Dominance (>60%)

**Characteristics:**
- Capital concentrated in Bitcoin
- Risk-off sentiment in crypto
- Flight to quality
- Early bull or late bear market

**Trading Implications:**
- Focus on Bitcoin
- Altcoin opportunities limited
- Safer market conditions
- Potential alt season ahead

### Low Dominance (<45%)

**Characteristics:**
- Capital spread across altcoins
- Risk-on sentiment
- Speculation elevated
- Often late-cycle euphoria

**Trading Implications:**
- Altcoins may outperform
- Higher risk environment
- Potential market top forming
- Consider taking profits

### Moderate Dominance (45-55%)

**Characteristics:**
- Balanced market
- No strong directional signal
- Rotation possible
- Transition period

## Dominance and Market Cycles

### The Typical Cycle Pattern

```
Phase 1: Bear Market Bottom
BTC.D: Rising (60%+)
→ Bitcoin bottoms first
→ Capital flees to "safety"
→ Altcoins bleed harder

Phase 2: Early Bull Market
BTC.D: Stable high (55-65%)
→ Bitcoin leads recovery
→ Altcoins lag
→ Smart money accumulates BTC

Phase 3: Mid Bull Market
BTC.D: Starting to decline (50-55%)
→ Bitcoin rallies continue
→ Some altcoins start catching up
→ Rotation begins

Phase 4: Alt Season
BTC.D: Declining rapidly (40-45%)
→ Altcoins explode
→ Bitcoin moves sideways or slowly
→ Speculation peaks

Phase 5: Market Top
BTC.D: At lows, then reverses (~35-40%)
→ Dominance bottom often marks cycle top
→ Capital starts fleeing back to BTC
→ Bear market begins
```

## Trading with Dominance

### Strategy 1: Dominance Reversal Trade

**Long Bitcoin Signal:**
- BTC.D hits multi-month low
- Shows reversal pattern (double bottom, bullish divergence)
- Altcoins showing weakness
- Action: Rotate from alts to BTC

**Long Altcoins Signal:**
- BTC.D hits multi-month high
- Shows reversal pattern
- Bitcoin consolidating after rally
- Action: Consider alt exposure

### Strategy 2: Dominance Trend Following

**Rising Dominance:**
```
BTC.D trending up
→ Stay in Bitcoin
→ Avoid or short altcoins
→ Wait for trend change
```

**Falling Dominance:**
```
BTC.D trending down
→ Consider alt allocation
→ Don't abandon Bitcoin entirely
→ Watch for exhaustion
```

### Strategy 3: Divergence Trading

**Bullish BTC Divergence:**
- BTC price falling
- BTC.D rising
- Signal: BTC outperforming on weakness = relative strength

**Bearish Alt Divergence:**
- Alt prices rising
- BTC.D rising
- Signal: Alts underperforming on strength = relative weakness

## Factors Affecting Dominance

### Increasing Dominance

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Bitcoin ETF inflows | Direct BTC demand |
| Macro uncertainty | Flight to quality |
| Altcoin scandals | Risk-off |
| Bitcoin halving anticipation | BTC focus |
| Institutional accumulation | Prefer BTC |

### Decreasing Dominance

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| New altcoin launches | Market cap dilution |
| Alt season speculation | Capital rotation |
| DeFi/NFT narratives | Attention shifts |
| Bitcoin consolidation | Seeking returns elsewhere |
| Low funding rates | Leverage moves to alts |

## Dominance Considerations

### The "Stablecoin Problem"

Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) affect dominance calculation:

```
If stablecoins are 10% of market cap:
- They dilute BTC dominance
- But they're not competing for capital
- Some analysts exclude stablecoins
- "Real" BTC dominance may be higher
```

### New Tokens Inflation

Every new token launch dilutes BTC dominance:
- Thousands of new tokens yearly
- Most have minimal value
- Creates downward bias in dominance
- Historical comparisons need context

### Market Cap vs. Liquidity

High market cap ≠ high liquidity:
- Many altcoins have inflated caps
- Illiquid tokens can't absorb selling
- BTC liquidity far exceeds dominance ratio
- True "dominance" in liquidity is higher

## Reading Dominance Charts

### Key Levels to Watch

| Level | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| 60% | Major resistance (alt season if breaks down) |
| 55% | Moderate level |
| 50% | Psychological level |
| 45% | Major support (reversal if breaks up) |
| 40% | Historical floor (cycle top zone) |

### Patterns That Work

| Pattern | Signal |
|---------|--------|
| Double bottom in BTC.D | Alt season ending |
| Double top in BTC.D | Alt season starting |
| Higher lows in BTC.D | Bullish BTC bias |
| Lower highs in BTC.D | Alt season building |

## Dominance Pairs Trading

### BTC vs ETH Dominance

Track ETH/BTC ratio alongside BTC.D:

| BTC.D | ETH/BTC | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Rising | Falling | Risk-off, BTC preferred |
| Rising | Rising | Both gaining vs alts |
| Falling | Rising | ETH and alts gaining |
| Falling | Falling | Alts outperforming both |

### Sector Rotation

```
Capital flow pattern:
BTC → ETH → Large caps → Mid caps → Small caps → BTC

Watch dominance to time rotation
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Trading Dominance in Isolation

**Mistake:** "BTC.D is low, time to buy Bitcoin"
**Reality:** Low dominance can stay low. Need trend change confirmation.

### 2. Ignoring Absolute Prices

**Mistake:** "BTC.D rising, Bitcoin is doing well"
**Reality:** Dominance can rise while both BTC and alts fall (BTC just falls less).

### 3. Over-Extrapolating History

**Mistake:** "Dominance always returns to 60%+"
**Reality:** Market structure evolves. Historical levels may not repeat.

### 4. Precision Trading

**Mistake:** Trading every 1% dominance move
**Reality:** Use dominance for broader bias, not scalping.

## Dominance Quick Reference

| BTC.D Level | Environment | BTC Strategy | Alt Strategy |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| >60% | Risk-off | Accumulate | Avoid/minimal |
| 55-60% | Transitioning | Hold | Selective |
| 50-55% | Balanced | Hold | Cautious add |
| 45-50% | Risk-on | Hold core | Active |
| <45% | Euphoria | Take profits | Trim soon |

## Summary

Bitcoin dominance provides macro context for crypto markets:

- **High dominance** = Safety preference, early cycle or bear market
- **Low dominance** = Risk appetite, late cycle or alt season
- **Rising dominance** = Favor Bitcoin over alts
- **Falling dominance** = Consider alt exposure
- **Extreme levels** = Watch for reversals

Use dominance as a filter for allocation decisions, not as a standalone trading signal.
