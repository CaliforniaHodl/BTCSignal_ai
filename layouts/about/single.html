    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="lead">We believe quality Bitcoin data and metrics shouldn't cost $100+/month or require trusting anonymous "gurus" on social media.</p>
    <p>BTC Signal was built to solve a simple problem: most retail traders either can't afford premium data tools like Glassnode or Coinglass, or they're stuck relying on influencers with hidden agendas. We wanted to create something different—transparent data and analysis available to anyone for the cost of a few satoshis.</p>

  <!-- Why We Built This -->
  <section class="about-section story-section">
    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
      <p>The crypto data space is broken. On one side, you have expensive institutional tools like Glassnode that cost hundreds per month. On the other, you have free "signals" from anonymous Twitter accounts who are often front-running their followers or getting paid to shill.</p>
      <p>We saw an opportunity: aggregate useful Bitcoin data from public sources, and use the Lightning Network to make it accessible to everyone through micropayments. No subscriptions, no lock-in, no hidden fees.</p>
      <p>Our data comes from transparent sources. We show you the math. No mysterious algorithms, no black boxes—just clear data and metrics you can verify.</p>
