    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="lead">We believe quality Bitcoin analysis shouldn't cost $100+/month or require trusting anonymous "gurus" on social media.</p>
    <p>BTC Signal AI was built to solve a simple problem: most retail traders either can't afford premium analysis tools, or they're stuck relying on influencers with hidden agendas. We wanted to create something different—transparent, AI-powered analysis available to anyone for the cost of a few satoshis.</p>

  <!-- Why We Built This -->
  <section class="about-section story-section">
    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
      <p>The crypto analysis space is broken. On one side, you have expensive institutional tools that cost hundreds per month. On the other, you have free "signals" from anonymous Twitter accounts who are often front-running their followers or getting paid to shill.</p>
      <p>We saw an opportunity: use AI to generate unbiased technical analysis, and use Bitcoin's Lightning Network to make it accessible to everyone through micropayments. No subscriptions, no lock-in, no hidden fees.</p>
      <p>Our AI doesn't have bags to pump. It doesn't get emotional during market crashes. It just analyzes the data and tells you what it sees.</p>
