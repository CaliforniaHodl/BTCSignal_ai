      <h2>About Our Service</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is BTC Signal?</h3>
        <p>BTC Signal is a Bitcoin data service—think of it as a lightweight Glassnode alternative. We aggregate on-chain metrics, funding rates, liquidation data, open interest, and more from public sources. Our goal is to provide affordable, data-driven analysis to help you make more informed trading decisions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you trade on my behalf?</h3>
        <p><strong>No, absolutely not.</strong> We are strictly an information and analysis service. We do not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Execute trades for you</li>
          <li>Manage your funds or portfolio</li>
          <li>Have access to your exchange accounts</li>
          <li>Provide personalized financial advice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All trading decisions are yours alone. We simply provide data and analysis to assist your research.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What makes BTC Signal different?</h3>
        <p>We focus on making quality Bitcoin data accessible at a low cost. Instead of expensive monthly subscriptions like Glassnode ($29+/month), we offer flexible Lightning Network payments starting at just 21 sats per signal. Our data-driven approach provides consistent, transparent metrics from verifiable public sources.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this financial advice?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Nothing on this website constitutes financial, investment, or trading advice. Our analysis is for informational and educational purposes only. Always do your own research (DYOR) and consider consulting a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p>

    <!-- Data & Methodology -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where does your data come from?</h3>
        <p>We aggregate data from multiple reliable public sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price Data:</strong> Binance US, CoinGecko, CoinCap (real-time spot prices)</li>
          <li><strong>Derivatives Data:</strong> Bybit, OKX (funding rates, open interest)</li>
          <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Alternative.me Fear & Greed Index</li>
          <li><strong>On-Chain Data:</strong> Mempool.space (hashrate, network metrics)</li>
          <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> CoinGecko (dominance, global metrics)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is fetched from public APIs and cached periodically to ensure accuracy while avoiding rate limits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How are signals generated?</h3>
        <p>Our signals are calculated using multiple data points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, and chart patterns</li>
          <li><strong>Derivatives Data:</strong> Funding rates, open interest, liquidation levels</li>
          <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Fear & Greed Index, long/short ratios</li>
          <li><strong>On-Chain Metrics:</strong> Hashrate trends, network activity</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These factors are combined to generate a directional bias (bullish/bearish/neutral) with a confidence score. No black boxes—you can verify our data sources.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How often is analysis updated?</h3>
        <p>We publish new analysis posts regularly throughout the day. Dashboard widgets update in real-time (every 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the metric). Market conditions are monitored 24/7.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What timeframe do your signals cover?</h3>
        <p>Our primary analysis focuses on the 4-hour (4H) timeframe, which balances short-term trading opportunities with noise reduction. However, we also consider daily and weekly trends for context. Each analysis post specifies the relevant timeframe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How accurate are your signals?</h3>
        <p>We track and publish our historical performance transparently on the Dashboard. Like any analysis method, our signals are not 100% accurate. Past performance does not guarantee future results. We provide confidence scores with each signal to indicate the strength of the analysis.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
