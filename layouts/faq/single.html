        <h3>Is this financial advice?</h3>
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Nothing on this website constitutes financial, investment, or trading advice. Our analysis is for informational and educational purposes only.

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where does your data come from?</h3>
        <p>We aggregate data from multiple reliable sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price Data:</strong> Binance, Coinbase (real-time spot prices)</li>
          <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Alternative.me Fear & Greed Index</li>
          <li><strong>On-Chain Data:</strong> Blockchain.info (hashrate, network metrics)</li>
          <li><strong>Trading Metrics:</strong> Binance API (volume, order book data)</li>
          <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> CoinGecko (dominance, global metrics)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is fetched in real-time from public APIs to ensure accuracy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the AI generate signals?</h3>
        <p>Our analysis uses Claude AI to process multiple data points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, and chart patterns</li>
          <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Fear & Greed Index, funding rates, long/short ratios</li>
          <li><strong>On-Chain Metrics:</strong> Hashrate trends, network activity</li>
          <li><strong>Volume Analysis:</strong> Buy/sell pressure, liquidity zones</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The AI weighs these factors to generate a directional bias (bullish/bearish/neutral) with a confidence score.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How often is analysis updated?</h3>
        <p>We publish new analysis posts regularly throughout the day. Dashboard widgets update in real-time (every 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the metric). Market conditions are monitored 24/7.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What timeframe do your signals cover?</h3>
        <p>Our primary analysis focuses on the 4-hour (4H) timeframe, which balances short-term trading opportunities with noise reduction. However, we also consider daily and weekly trends for context. Each analysis post specifies the relevant timeframe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How accurate are your signals?</h3>
        <p>We track and publish our historical performance transparently on the Dashboard. Like any analysis method, our signals are not 100% accurate. Past performance does not guarantee future results. We provide confidence scores with each signal to indicate the strength of the analysis.</p>
