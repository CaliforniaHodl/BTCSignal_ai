---

### Phase 7: Access Recovery & Persistence (COMPLETE)
*Goal: Solve the "lost localStorage = lost access" problem for paid subscribers*
*Priority: High (critical for yearly pass viability)*

**The Problem:**
- Access tokens stored in browser localStorage
- Clearing browser data = losing paid access
- No way to transfer access between devices
- Yearly pass customers especially affected
- No KYC = no email to recover with

**Sprint 1: Recovery Code System (Week 1-2)** - COMPLETE
- [x] Generate unique recovery codes on purchase (format: `BTCSIG-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)
- [x] Create `data/access-records.json` to store: `{code, paymentHash, tier, purchaseDate, expiresAt}`
- [x] Create `netlify/functions/store-access.ts` - called after successful payment
- [x] Create `netlify/functions/recover-access.ts` - validates code and returns access
- [x] Update payment flow to display recovery code prominently after purchase
- [x] Add "Save this code!" modal with copy button and download option
- [x] Store recovery code in localStorage alongside access token

**Sprint 2: Recovery UI (Week 2-3)** - COMPLETE
- [x] Add "Recover Access" link to pricing page and locked content
- [x] Create `/recover/` page with recovery code input
- [x] Validate code format client-side before API call
- [x] On success: restore access token to localStorage, redirect to dashboard
- [x] On failure: show helpful error message with support contact
- [x] Add recovery code display to user's current access status

**Sprint 3: Payment Hash Backup (Week 3-4)** - COMPLETE
- [x] Allow recovery via Lightning payment hash (backup method)
- [x] User can paste their payment hash from wallet history
- [x] Server looks up payment hash in access records
- [x] Useful when user lost recovery code but has wallet transaction history
- [x] Add "Lost your code? Try payment hash" option on recovery page

**Sprint 4: Multi-Device Sync (Week 4-5)** - Optional Enhancement
- [ ] QR code to transfer access between devices
- [ ] Device A shows QR with encrypted access token
- [ ] Device B scans and imports access
- [ ] No server needed, peer-to-peer via QR
- [ ] Alternative: shareable recovery link (one-time use)

**Data Schema:**
```json
// data/access-records.json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "recoveryCode": "BTCSIG-A7X9-K2M4-P8Q1",
      "paymentHash": "abc123...",
      "tier": "yearly",
      "amountSats": 400000,
      "purchaseDate": "2024-12-05T10:30:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2025-12-05T10:30:00Z",
      "recoveryCount": 0,
      "lastRecovery": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/.netlify/functions/store-access` | POST | Store new access record after payment |
| `/.netlify/functions/recover-access` | POST | Validate recovery code/payment hash |
| `/.netlify/functions/check-access` | GET | Verify if access record exists |

**Success Criteria:** ALL MET
- [x] Recovery codes generated and displayed on every purchase
- [x] Users can recover access on new device/browser
- [x] Payment hash backup method working
- [x] Recovery page accessible from pricing and locked content
- [x] Access records persisted in GitHub (survives deploys)

**Security Considerations:**
- Recovery codes are single-use per device (increment recoveryCount)
- Rate limit recovery attempts (prevent brute force)
- Codes expire when access expires
- No PII stored - just codes, hashes, and timestamps

**UX Flow:**
```
Purchase → Payment Success → Show Recovery Code Modal → User Saves Code
                                    ↓
Lost Access → Go to /recover/ → Enter Code → Access Restored
                                    ↓
              Lost Code? → Enter Payment Hash → Access Restored
```

**Positioning After Phase 7:**
> "Buy once, access anywhere. Your recovery code works on any device, any browser - no accounts needed, no KYC required."

**FAQ Content to Add:**

**Q: Why do you use Nostr for login?**
> We're Bitcoin-native, so we use Bitcoin-native auth. Nostr uses the same cryptography as Bitcoin (secp256k1 keys). No email, no password, no KYC - just sign a message with your keys. If you can use a Lightning wallet, you can use Nostr.

**Q: What if I don't have a Nostr account?**
> You can still purchase access and use a recovery code. But we recommend setting up Nostr - it takes 2 minutes with Alby (browser extension) and you'll have a censorship-resistant identity that works across hundreds of apps.

**Q: Is my npub public?**
> Your npub (public key) is like a Bitcoin address - it's meant to be shared. We only store your npub, never your nsec (private key). We can't post as you, access your DMs, or do anything except verify you are who you claim to be.

**Dependencies:**
- `nostr-tools` - Core Nostr library (signing, verification)
- NIP-07 - Browser extension standard
- NIP-42 - Authentication event kind (22242)
- NIP-46 - Nostr Connect (mobile support, optional)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can purchase and authenticate with only Nostr keys
- [ ] No email or recovery code required for new users
- [ ] Existing recovery code users can link npub
- [ ] FAQ explains Nostr auth clearly
- [ ] Pricing page explains the "why" of Nostr
- [ ] Works with nos2x, Alby, and Flamingo extensions

**Positioning After Phase 11:**
> "The only Bitcoin signal platform with Nostr-native auth. No email. No password. No KYC. Just your keys."

**Sprint 6: React Native Migration** ⏳ PENDING
*Investment: Time + Apple Developer ($99/year) + Google Play ($25 one-time)*
*Timeline: 2-3 months for MVP*

**Why React Native:**
- Single codebase for iOS + Android
- Can share logic with web (if refactor web to React)
- Large ecosystem (libraries, talent)
- Expo for faster development
- OTA updates (bypass app store for fixes)

**Migration Strategy:**

**Option A: Full Rewrite (Recommended)**
```
Current: Hugo (static) + Netlify Functions
    ↓
New Web: Next.js + React (SSR/SSG)
    ↓
Mobile: React Native (shared components)
```

**Option B: Mobile-Only Native**
```
Keep: Hugo + Netlify (web)
Add: React Native app (separate codebase)
Share: API layer only
```

**Recommended: Option A** - More work upfront, but unified codebase.

**Phase 1: Web Refactor (Next.js)**
- [ ] Set up Next.js project
- [ ] Migrate static pages (Hugo → Next.js SSG)
- [ ] Migrate dynamic pages (Hugo JS → React components)
- [ ] Keep Netlify Functions (or migrate to Next.js API routes)
- [ ] Ensure parity with Hugo site
- [ ] Redirect old URLs

**Phase 2: Shared Component Library**
- [ ] Extract UI components (buttons, cards, charts)
- [ ] Create shared design tokens (colors, spacing)
- [ ] Build shared hooks (useAuth, useMarketData)
- [ ] Publish as internal package or monorepo

**Phase 3: React Native App**
- [ ] Initialize with Expo
- [ ] Implement auth flow (Nostr signing)
- [ ] Implement core screens:
  - Dashboard (market overview)
  - Liquidation Map
  - Price Alerts (push notifications)
  - Pattern Scanner
  - Trade Coach
- [ ] Platform-specific: Push notifications, biometrics, widgets

**Phase 4: App Store Submission**
- [ ] Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- [ ] Google Play Developer account ($25)
- [ ] App Store screenshots and metadata
- [ ] Privacy policy (required)
- [ ] App review compliance (no "financial advice" claims)
- [ ] TestFlight beta testing
- [ ] Submit and iterate on review feedback

**React Native Tech Stack:**
- [ ] Expo (managed workflow)
- [ ] React Navigation (routing)
- [ ] Zustand or Jotai (state management)
- [ ] React Query (data fetching)
- [ ] NativeWind (Tailwind for RN) or styled-components
- [ ] react-native-svg (charts)
- [ ] expo-notifications (push)
- [ ] expo-secure-store (Nostr keys)
